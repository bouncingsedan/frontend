A frontend for the OpenAgent Junior Software Engineer Tech Test.

To run, simply create a file called `.env`, set the only environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to the running backend URL.

Make sure the backend is running and URL matches the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` set URL. Install packages, and run dev.

The frontend is a straightforward Next.js app. Made use of ReactBits for the following:
* [Rotating Text](https://www.reactbits.dev/text-animations/rotating-text)
* [Squares](https://www.reactbits.dev/backgrounds/squares)

Made use of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) for boilerplate UI components.

Pages in the app:
* Contact Us page, upon submitting the form, directs to a thank-you page.
* Contacts page for managing the contacts list, as per requirements, a verify button and delete button are present.
